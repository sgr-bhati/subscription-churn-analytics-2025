# 📘 Day 1 — Project Setup & Initial Exploration (Enhanced Summary)

### ✅ 1. Project & Repository Setup
- Understood the **complete project folder structure** and its purpose.
- Learned how to use **GitHub**, including:
  - Initializing a repository
  - Committing changes
  - Understanding `.gitignore`
  - Syncing project files properly
- Created the full folder structure following best practices.
